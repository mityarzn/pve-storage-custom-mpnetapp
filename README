    Proxmox VE plugin to deal with Netapp SANs.

Designed to work over open-iscsi or FC multipath. Also works over
libiscsi, but this mode gives strange behavior, so is not recommended.

Currently tested over open-iscsi multipath. My SAN works in "7-mode",
but plugin should work with cluster-mode setups. Set in in config
(seel below). Testing and patches for cluster-mode would be much
appreciated.

To work over multipath, you need to set
     uid_attribute ID_WWN_WITH_EXTENSION
in /etc/multipath.conf and blacklist by default all SAN's LUNs.

Here's my config:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
defaults {
        polling_interval        2
        path_selector           "round-robin 0"
        path_grouping_policy    multibus
        uid_attribute           ID_WWN_WITH_EXTENSION
        rr_min_io               100
        failback                immediate
        no_path_retry           queue
        user_friendly_names     yes
        path_checker            tur
}
blacklist {
        wwid .*
}
blacklist_exceptions {
}
multipaths {
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

PVE currently doesn't offers interface to add custom plugins via GUI,
so storage needs to be configured manually. Here's my
/etc/pve/storage.conf part:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpnetapp: filer1
        content images,rootdir
        adminserver 10.X.Y.Z
        login pve
        password some-password
        aggregate aggr0
        api 7
        igroup pve-test
        media multipath
        target iqn.1992-08.com.netapp:sn.111111111
        shared 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For cluster-mode you need to chande api to 8 and add vserver property
with hostname/ipaddress of vserver for this cluster.

igroup is initiator group manually configured on SAN. Can be either
iSCSI or FC group.

If you set media to iscsi, then storage will use libiscsi for LUN access
in qemu. LXC can't use libiscsi. This mode could bring some advantages,
but I experienced some strange bugs in it, so I dont'recomment it.
